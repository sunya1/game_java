# game_java
(Personal Project)
I implemented a simple game simulation (similar to “Packman”) using JavaFX and OOP. The game is started with a command-line argument representing the file that describes a specific map for the game.
The basic options of the player are:
 1)Move within the map (table) in four directions: right, left, up, down;
 2)Collect the food that appears in some region of the given map.

The game finishes when there is no more food to eat, and displays the total points.
